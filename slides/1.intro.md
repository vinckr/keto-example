### Basic Idea

- relations between objects and subjects
- subjects can be referenced indirectly by object and relation

```keto-relation-tuples
object0#access@user0
object1#access@(object0#access)
```

NOTES

- relationtuple result in graph of indirections
- operations are "standard" graph algorithms
- check request boils down to reachability
