    </li>

      <a href="https://github.com/ory/keto/issues/263">issue #263</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>rewrite would express that owner is an alias for read</li>
        <li>
          because it is defined on the top-level configuration, data will not
          change when permissions change
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>current workaround: add tuples that represent that alias</li>
  </ul>
